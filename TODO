TODO LIST :

- Manage unsuccessful transmissions (channel or output power change)
- Decrease system clock when idle for improving power saving (from 125kHz to 31kHz)
- Add fields for sensor module identification / address
- Add field for sensor module informations (bad/missed transmissions count, DHT22 sensor error)
- Increase duration between transmissions when battery level is critical (power saving feature)
- Allow receiving capabilities for configuration purposes (address, channel, transmission power, periodicity)
